- This application detects moving objects in front of a camera and record the time-stamp when the object enters and exits the camera frame.
- Additionally, this application also visualize this recorded data with an interactive graph.
- To run the application, simply execute the file plot.py. To stop the application, press 'q' from the keyboard.
- Note : Make sure that the first frame after starting the application should be the ideal background (i.e. without any moving objects) that is to be used as base frame.
